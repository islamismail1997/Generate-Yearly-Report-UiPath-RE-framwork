# Generate-Yearly-Report-UiPath-RE-framwork

The "Generate Yearly Report" assignment is a part of the UiPath RPA Developer Advanced Certification course. The assignment involves automating the process of generating a yearly report for a certain vendor, which includes downloading invoices from a specified webpage, processing them to extract the relevant data, and generating a report in the required format. The robot needs to extract the vendor name, vendor tax ID, invoice date, invoice number, and invoice item description from the downloaded invoices, and then aggregate this data to generate a yearly report. The report should include the total amount per vendor and per month, as well as the grand total for the entire year. The assignment requires the use of UiPath Studio to develop a complete automation solution, including the use of various activities, such as web scraping, data manipulation, and report generation. The solution should also handle exceptions and errors, and be able to retry failed operations.
